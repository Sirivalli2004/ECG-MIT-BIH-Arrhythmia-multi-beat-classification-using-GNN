# ECG-MIT-BIH-Arrhythmia-multi-beat-classification-using-GNN
CardioECGNet-GNN is a graph-based deep learning framework for automated ECG arrhythmia classification.  The method models ECG beats as nodes in a graph and uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to capture  inter-beat relationships, improving robustness and interpretability.
